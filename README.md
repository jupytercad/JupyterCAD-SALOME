# jupytercad_salome

[![Github Actions Status](https://github.com/jupytercad/jupytercad-salome/workflows/Build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jupytercad/jupytercad-salome/actions/workflows/build.yml)
A JupyterLab extension.

JupyterCAD-Salome is a backend extension for JupyterCAD which enables users to generate meshes from their creations in JupyterCAD, leveraging the powerful meshing capabilities of Salome, a leading open-source platform for numerical simulation.

JupyterCAD-Salome is currently in active development.

As you can see in the video above, JupyterCAD-Salome will add a new button to the JupyterCAD toolbar allowing to generate a mesh from the currently selected object.
