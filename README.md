[![Github Actions Status](https://github.com/jupytercad/jupytercad-salome/workflows/Build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jupytercad/jupytercad-salome/actions/workflows/build.yml)

`JupyterCAD-Salome` is an extension for JupyterCAD which enables users to generate meshes from their creations in JupyterCAD, leveraging the powerful meshing capabilities of Salome, a leading open-source platform for numerical simulation.

`JupyterCAD-Salome` is currently in active development.

As you can see in the video above, `JupyterCAD-Salome` will add a new button to the JupyterCAD toolbar allowing to generate a mesh from the currently selected object in the JupyterCAD viewer.

## Try it live

A deployment is published for you to give it a try:
https://trungleduc-jupytercad.hf.space/lab

This demo is entirely collaborative, which means anybody getting to this link will
see what you do and be able to collaborate with you.

You can make your own deployment on HuggingFace pressing the "â‹®" button on the top-right corner of the page, then "Duplicate this Space"

## Local Install

1. Install Salome from https://www.salome-platform.org/?page_id=2430
2. To install the extension, execute:
   ```bash
   pip install jupyterlab
   pip install --pre jupytercad jupytercad-salome
   ```

Then you can either start JupyterLab or JupyterCAD:

```bash
jupyter lab
# OR
jupyter cad
```

## Implementation

`JupyterCAD-Salome` consists of two components:

- A `jupyter-server` endpoint which is ready to compute the mesh upon client demand. This endpoint is defined using [an OpenAPI spec](https://github.com/jupytercad/jupytercad-salome/blob/main/jupytercad_salome/schema/openapi.yaml). Users are not bound to the provided jupyter-server endpoint, `JupyterCAD-Salome` can connect to any server implementing the OpenAPI spec.

> [!NOTE]
> To use `JupyterCAD-Salome` with a different Salome server, set the `SALOME_SERVER_BASE_URL` environment variable to your server address before starting `JupyterLab`.

- A client plugin for JupyterCAD adding UI elements to interact with the mesh-generation endpoint. Whenever the user clicks on the toolbar button, they are prompted with a dialog to configure the API call:

> [!NOTE]
> This user interface is generated automatically from [this schema file](https://github.com/jupytercad/jupytercad-salome/blob/main/src/schema.json).

Once the API call is made, the server will compute the mesh using the [smesh library](https://www.salome-platform.org/?page_id=374) and send back the response with the computed mesh to the client.

The user can later on re-generated the mesh with different inputs:
